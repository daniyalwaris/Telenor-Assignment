This purpose of this is to automates the broadband product availability flow on [Telenor.se], Where simulating a user's experience from landing on the homepage to selecting a broadband product based on address and apartment selection.

## âœ… Purpose
This automation test is built for a job assignment and demonstrates:
- Modular and reusable page object design.
- Handling of dynamic and frequently changing UI.
- Element interactions (keyboard-based navigation, dropdown selections, etc.)



## ðŸ§ª Test Scenario
The test performs the following steps:
1. **Navigate to** `https://www.telenor.se/`
2. **Accept cookies**
3. Open the **"Handla"** (or A/B variant: "Produkter och tjÃ¤nster") menu
4. Click the **"Bredband"** option
5. Search for a given **address** (e.g. `"Storgatan 1, Stockholm"`)
6. Select a **random apartment** from the dropdown list

## ðŸš€ How to Run
dotnet test


## ðŸ§  Design Considerations
- Reusable page objects: Designed to support future tests without rewriting logic.
- Robust selectors: Uses multiple elements locators that can handle layout changes.
- Keyboard interaction: Dropdowns and listboxes use Keys.ArrowDown and Keys.Enter where needed.
- Handles layout shifts like "Handla" vs "Produkter och tjÃ¤nster".


## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
- Add support for parallel execution.
- Cross-browser testing
- Reporting - Allure or Extended Reporting
